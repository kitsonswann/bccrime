**Interactive Web Application of BC Crime Data:**
By Kitson Swann

As a simple example, I created an interactive web application allowing a user to view a customizable time series visualization of different crime related statistics for policing jurisdictions within British Columbia, using data from Open Data BC.

In order to produce this interactive application, I downloaded the data, cleaned and reformatted it. I then built an interactive application using the R programming language, the open source interactive development environment (IDE) RStudio and the web application framework for R called Shiny.

The application allows you to select a statistic, a time period in years, a single region and multiple policing jurisdictions, and displays a dynamic time series plot.
